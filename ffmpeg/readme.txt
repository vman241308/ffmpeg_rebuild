In this folder, you need to put your ffmpeg binaries, library files and includes.

The structure should be as follows:
/include contains all header files for the ffmpeg project
/lib contains all .lib files

For Windows, you can get the necessary files from:
https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

Download the dev version and extract it into this folder.
Make sure that lib and include are present.
